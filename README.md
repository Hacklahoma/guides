# Creating a React App

This is a guide to creating your first app with React! In this walkthrough will have you building an application in React from scratch and learning some cool tools that come with it.

# Prerequisites

Before we dive in, there are a few things that you should know in advance before you start playing around with React. 

- Basic knowledge of [HTML & CSS](https://www.internetingishard.com/).
- Basic familiarity of [JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript) and/or programming.
- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are installed globally.

# Goal

By the end of this guide, you should have a good idea of how to create a React app and familiarty of concepts such as JSX, components, props, state, and lifecycle.

# What is React?

- React is **one of the most popular JavaScript** libraries with over 150,000 stars on GitHub.
- React is an open-sourced repository created by **Facebook**.
- React is used on the **front-end** for building user interfaces (UI).
- React is **component-based** meaning you can reuse encapsulated components that manage their own state then compose them to make a complex UI.
- React streamlines how data is stored and handled, using **state** and **props**.

Throughout this guide, we'll go over more about React with hands on learning.

# Setup and Installation

Before we setup our first React app, verify that you have [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed globally. This will be important to create and run our app.

After these tools are installed, we can use Facebook's pre-configured environment,  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This will create a new folder with everything you need to build a React app.

To setup `create-react-app`, run the following code in your terminal where you want your project directory to live.

<pre>
npx create-react-app myapp
</pre>

This might take a little bit to install if it is your first time installing. Once it's finished, move into the newly created directory and start the project

<pre>
cd myapp
npm start
</pre>

After running this command, a new window will open at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) with your new React app that will look similar to below.
